# Segmentation

- In earlier systems, each process (a running program) had its entire address space (the range of memory addresses it uses) loaded into physical memory using a single base and bounds register pair:
    - Base register: Points to the starting physical memory address where the process is loaded.
    - Bounds register: Specifies the size of the process’s address space to prevent it from accessing memory outside its allocated area.

- **Segmentation**: solves this problem by dividing the address space into logical segments each with its own base and bound register.

- each segment is a contiguous chunk of the address space and the os can place these segments anywhere in physical memory independently of each other.

- the MMU in the hardware uses a set of segment registers to translate virtual addresses to physical ones
    each segment has the following:
    - base: starting physical address
    - size (bounds): length of the segment
    - protection bits: permissions like read and write 
    - growth direction: indicates if the segment grows upward or downward

- A segmentation fault occurs when a program accesses an invalid address:
    - Outside a segment’s bounds. 
    - Violating protection.
