# Mechanism: Address Translation

- Limited Direct Execution (LDE): let the program run directly on the hardware, arrange so that the OS when gets involved it do the right thing 
- Hardware based address translation - address translation: the hardware transforms each memory address provided by the instruction to a physical address where the desired information is actually located
- **Managing Memory**: is the job of os to keep track of which locations are free and which are in use and judiciously intervening to maintain control over how memory is used.
- the Ugly truth is: many programs are actually sharing memory ar the same time as CPU/s switches between running one program and the next.

## Dynamic (Hardware Based) Relocation

- base and bounds: 2 hardware registers within each CPU, one base and other bounds aka limit, their goal is to ensure that the process can only access its own address space.
- when program starts running the os decides where in physical memory it should be loaded and sets the base register to that value, *physical address = virtual address + base*

- the relocation of the address happens at runtime and can move address spaces of process even after the process has start running 

-  the OS must save and restore the base-and-bounds pair when it switches between processes in some per-process structure such as the process structure or process control block (PCB).

- base and bounds registers is obviously privileged.
