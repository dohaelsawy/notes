# Interlude: Memory API

## Types of Memory
- Stack Memory- Automatic: allocations and deallocations of it are manages implicitly by the compiler
- Heap Memory: all allocations and deallocations are explicitly handled by programmer 

## The *malloc()* Call
- *malloc()* takes a size and ask for a room on the heap, and returns pointer to the newly allocated space or null in fails 
- use *sizeof* to ensure portability by calculating type size instead of hardcoding
- *sizeof(pointer)* returns the pointer size not the allocated memory size 
- Use strlen(s) + 1 to include space for the null terminator (\0)
- casting in c++ is mandatory but not required in c 
    ```c
    int *x = (int*) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    ```

## the *free()* Call
- the routine takes one argument, a pointer that was returned by *malloc()* and free the heap memory for that pointer

## Common Errors
- **Segmentation Fault**: is access a memory before allocating.
    ```c
    char *src = "hello";
    char *dst; // oops! unallocated
    strcpy(dst, src); // segfault and die


    char *src = "hello";
    char *dst = (char *) malloc(strlen(src) + 1);
    strcpy(dst, src); // work properly

    ```

- **Buffer Overflow**: not allocating enough memory 
    ```c
    char *src = "hello";
    char *dst = (char *) malloc(strlen(src)); // too small!
    strcpy(dst, src); // work properly
    ```

- **Uninitialized Read**: read from uninitialized allocated memory
- **Memory Leak**: forget to free memory  
- **Dangling Pinter**: free memory before it's finished using it.


- mmap() can create an anonymous memory region within your program a region which is not associated with any particular file but rather with swap space.
